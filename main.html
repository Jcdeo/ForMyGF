    <h2>Happy 17 birthday    ðŸŽ‚</h2>
    <p>Today is all about celebrating the amazing person you are, and I feel so lucky to call you mine. <br>
        Your kindness, beauty, and strength inspire me every day, and Iâ€™m so grateful to have you by my side. <br>
        You light up my world in ways I never thought possible, and I canâ€™t wait to make more incredible memories with you in the year ahead.
        <br>
        I hope your day is as special as you are to me. Wishing you all the love, happiness, and joy that your heart can hold.
        <br>
        Hereâ€™s to many more birthdays together! <br>
        I love you more than words can express. ðŸ’•
